#i will import libraries here - if you dont know what these libraries are, better start learning now itself, as for why i used fuzzy its down below.
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz # i will use fuzz to help me find products in dataset - here fuzzy will compare our search text to actual product name
from fuzzywuzzy import process # process is used to return the best match for searched product.

# Load the dataset nothing complex here, i will instead use a function to make it more pleasing, looks professional and for convenience ofcourse.
def load_data():
    file_path = "eco_friendly_product_cleaned.csv" #csv file is already cleaned - that is devoid of repetitions,and only unique values are present. yeah i checked each personally it sucks.
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    return df

df = load_data() #call function to load csv simple as that.

# for anyone who doesnt understand whats st? below, its short alias for streamlit,instead of writting streamlit.title we can simply use st as short cut, and we can still use same operation.

# Initialize session state for product_name
if "product_name" not in st.session_state:  # whats this session state you ask?? i learnt it before few hours too haha, basically It remembers values across user interactions (e.g., dropdown selections, text inputs).

# Product search input

# Product dropdown (Moved Below Text Input)  sad news, this drop below not's working i dont know why but godknows why. i will keep it.

# Fuzzy matching for manual entry - this is fuzzy comes in handy. here below you may see "score" this score is actually to see how much input string matches with product in database, and helps to find best match, since there are no repition this works really well since there is one of product with that name haha.
